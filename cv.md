## _About me_
\
I started studying the Front about two years ago, but, unfortunately, with interruptions, since the priorities were different and I had to interrupt often. I completed the FrontEnd Developer course and received a certificate, but I still donâ€™t have enough experience. Now it is only related to testing mailings - better than nothing, but I would like more. This area interests me very much, and I do not plan to stop only at the Front; after completing the course I will continue my studies and expand my area of â€‹â€‹knowledge. In my opinion, itâ€™s incredibly interesting to create something new and visually designed from a set of symbols. Itâ€™s like writing a book, but in code language. âœ¨Magicallyâœ¨ ðŸ˜Š
